You will also get to practice the Markdown syntax. \n\nExercise 2 consists of 3 problems. For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own solutions. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n\n**Please don't change the file name**, i.e. do all your editing in the provided `Exercise-2.ipynb` file. \n\n- **Exercise 2 is due by the start of the next lesson (9:15 am, 16 September 2020)**.\n- **We are [working in pairs](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/why-pairs.html) on this exercise**, and we will only grade the repository of the member of your pair that is responsible for this week's exercise.\n\n## Please note\n\n- The Python code cells where you should make changes will contain text that reads\n\n  ```Python\n  # YOUR CODE HERE\n  raise NotImplementedError()\n  ```\n  **You should delete that text and replace it with your code** to answer the related question\n- Some of the cells in this Jupyter Notebook are \"Read-only\" which means that you are not able to edit them.\n- Some of the code cells contain tests. If these tests fail (you see an error message), you know there is still something wrong with your code.\n\n## Where to find help\n\n- Review the [materials for Lesson 2](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/overview.html)\n- Check out [the hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/exercise-2.html#exercise-2-hints) on the course webpage\n\nStudents at the University of Helsinki are also encouraged to participate in the exercise sessions and discussion on Slack.
